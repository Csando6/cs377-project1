# cs377-project1


Hello, this is my cs377 project1 for cs377.

For this project, we had to take data collected from litterati.org and turn it into graphs and visualizations.
This project is written in R and is hosted in a web app using shinny.

In order to run this project, just type in runApp(app2.R) to launch the shinny app

While doing this project, there was a lot of interesting data. In the 24 hour graph, that plotted how much trash was picked up by hours of the day, there was more trash picked up during 4-8pm than in the morning. And for the 7 days of the week, the trash picked up did not follow any real pattern.
